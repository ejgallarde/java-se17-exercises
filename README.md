This project focuses on learnings that are covered in the OCJP Certification Exam.

This certification focuses on testing conceptual as well as practical Java programming skills. The exam comprises 50 multiple-choice questions that are designed to validate a developerâ€™s competencies in writing Java code that operates with primitives and objects; manipulates different types such as date, time, text, numeric, and boolean values; handles exceptions; and uses flow control constructs.

Exam candidates are expected to have a firm understanding of Java and an ability to practically apply different design styles, such as object-oriented approaches and functional programming with lambda expressions.

Candidates must demonstrate their knowledge of Java arrays, collections, and stream APIs; be able to implement multithreading, including dealing with the implications of the parallel processing of collections and streams; be able to work with file systems and use the Java IO and Java NIO APIs; implement localizations; access databases using JDBC; package and deploy Java code; and use the Java Platform Module System.

Expect questions that combine different language concepts. For example, you should expect to encounter the use of annotations and generics in many exam areas.
